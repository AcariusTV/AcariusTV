## AcariusTV
Hi, i'm Felix, also known as AcariusTV and i'm a german hobby software engineer. I mostly code in Rust or Go, but i also like C. I am still learning to hopefully find a job as a real software engineer in the future at some big tech company or something like that. You can contact me with my e-mail (`acariustv@web.de`) or just send me a dm on discord (`acariustv`).

Here is my favorite quote:
